I had referred to the following codes to better understand the corresponding papers (in Literature Survey):

| Project Name | Link |
|:---:|:---:|
| Odyssey | https://github.com/hungyipu/Odyssey |
| RAPTOR I | https://github.com/tbronzwaer/raptor |
| EventHorizonTelescope | https://github.com/mrummphys/EventHorizonTelescope |
| ynogk | http://www1.ynao.ac.cn/~yangxl/yxl.html |


P.S.: These did not affect the final API however, as can be confirmed by a simple comparison (Check `Code/GSoC Final Proposed API with Julia Wrapper.ipynb`).
